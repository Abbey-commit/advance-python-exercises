    " ### Threading / Concurrency Example\n",
    " Threads are processes which run in parallel to other threads. In a utopian scenario, if you split a big process in 2 threads, these\n",
    " threads will run in parallel so it would take half the time.\n",
    " This is not true in most cases. Using CPython, there is a mutex that prevents multiple native threads from executing Python byte\n",
    " codes at once. It’s called GIL (global interpreter lock). This lock is necessary mainly because CPython’s memory management\n",
    " is not thread-safe, but notice that I/O, image processing, and other potentially blocking operations, happen outside the GIL, so it\n",
    " will only become a bottle neck in processes that spend a lot of time inside the GIL.\n",
    " In most applications nowadays, concurrency is something we all must be able to handle. Mostly in web applications, where one\n",
    " request usually starts a thread, we need to have concurrency and threading in mind so we can write our programs accordingly.\n",
    " Threading is also a good solution to optimize response times. Given a scenario in which we have to process 4 million objects, a\n",
    " good thing to do would be divide them in 4 groups of a million objects and process them in 4 separated threads.\n",
    " \n",
    " #### 3.1 Python _thread module\n",
    " The _thread moduleis very effective for low level threading, let’s see an example to understand the concept. But keep in mind\n",
    " that since Python 2.4, this module is not used anymore.\n",
    " The process of spawning a thread is pretty simple. We just need to call a method called start_new_thread, available in\n",
    " the _thread module, which receives a function, and arguments to pass to it. It returns immediately and a thread will run in\n",
    " parallel. Let’s see:"
